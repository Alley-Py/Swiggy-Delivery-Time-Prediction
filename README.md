# 📌 Project Overview

This project develops an **end-to-end Machine Learning solution** to predict **Swiggy food delivery time (ETA)** using the **CRISP-ML(Q)** methodology. The model analyzes rider, order, environmental, geographical, and temporal factors to accurately estimate delivery time. The final solution is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application** for real-time ETA prediction.

---

# 🎯 Business Problem

Food delivery platforms like **Swiggy** process millions of orders every day, where accurate **Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)** plays a vital role in customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Delivery time is affected by several dynamic factors such as traffic, weather, delivery distance, rider performance, restaurant preparation time, and order demand. Inaccurate ETA predictions can lead to customer dissatisfaction, increased order cancellations, and inefficient resource utilization.

This project aims to build a data-driven machine learning solution capable of providing accurate and reliable delivery time predictions.

# 🏆 Final Model

**LightGBM Regressor** was selected as the final model because it achieved:

- Lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Highest R² Score
- Faster training and inference
- Excellent generalization capability
- High scalability for real-time deployment

# 🚀 Streamlit Deployment

The final preprocessing pipeline and trained LightGBM model were deployed using **Streamlit** to provide real-time ETA predictions. Users can enter rider, order, weather, traffic, and distance information through an interactive interface, while temporal features are generated automatically using Python's `datetime` module. The application preprocesses the input using the saved pipeline and instantly predicts the estimated delivery time.
